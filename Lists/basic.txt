Lists

std::list is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container.
Fast random access is not supported. It is usually implemented as a doubly-linked list.

list<int> numbers={1,2,3,332,12};
list<int> numb {32,2,9,79,0};
list<char> chars {'a', 'g', 'y', 'o'};
