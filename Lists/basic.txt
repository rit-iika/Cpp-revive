Lists

List is a contigous container. while vectors stores elements in different memory locations.
Random access of elements is possible in vectors, but not in lists. 

std::list is a container that supports constant time insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container.
Fast random access is not supported. It is usually implemented as a doubly-linked list.

list<int> numbers={1,2,3,332,12};
list<int> numb {32,2,9,79,0};
list<char> chars {'a', 'g', 'y', 'o'};
list<char> chars2 = {'a', 'g'};
