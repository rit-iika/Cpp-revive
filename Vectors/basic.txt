Vectors

The elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be accessed not only through iterators,
but also using offsets to regular pointers to elements. This means that a pointer to an element of a vector may be passed to any function
that expects a pointer to an element of an array.

Vectors usually occupy more space than static arrays, because more memory is allocated to handle future growth. 

The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on vectors is as follows:
Random access - constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements at the end - amortized constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements - linear in the distance to the end of the vector O(n)
