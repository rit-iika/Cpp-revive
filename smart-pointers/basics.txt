1. if anything is created inside heap memory, POinters are used.
2. through pointers, we use copy of resource to make any change. the actual resource is not changed. 
3. to change original copy of resource, smart pointers are used. 
4. they are used to delete the memory of unused resources
5. smart pointer is a class = pointer, operators(*, ->), destructor.
 

Issues with normal pointers..
1. memory leak - many times infinite loops or anything else could result into continous memory allocation,
but no delocation. 
therefore, this leads to excessive memory consumption.

2. Dangling pointers- 
a pointer pointing to 0 is Null Pointer
a pointer pointing to deleted location is dangling pointer.

3. buffer overflow


dynamic memory is memeory created on heap, it needs to be deleted by us.
smart pointers are pointers which can destroy themselves and thus no delete statement needs to be written for it.

smart pointers are of 3 kinds:
1. unique_ptr
2. shared_ptr
3. weak pointers

1. shared pointers
are pointers used to refer the same location
they use reference-counts concept, to track the number of counts. 
when this reference counter value == 0, then memeory is freed or deleted.

shared_ptr<int>ptr1;
shared_ptr<int>ptr2;


2. unique pointers
are pointers used to refer to only 1 location
no other variable/pointer can refer to this location
when unique pointer is destroyed, memory gets free

unique_ptr<int> ptr1;

3. weak pointer
are pointers similar to shared pointers
they just donot maintain/increment the reference count thus
they are called weak
