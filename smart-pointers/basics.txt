dynamic memory is memeory created on heap,
it needs to be deleted by us.
smart pointers are pointers which can destroy themselves and thus
no delete statement needs to be written for it.

smart pointers are of 3 kinds:
1. unique_ptr
2. shared_ptr
3. weak pointers

1. shared pointers
are pointers used to refer the same location
they use reference-counts concept, to track the number of counts. 
when this reference counter value == 0, then memeory is freed or deleted.

shared_ptr<int>ptr1;
shared_ptr<int>ptr2;


2. unique pointers
are pointers used to refer to only 1 location
no other variable/pointer can refer to this location
when unique pointer is destroyed, memory gets free

unique_ptr<int> ptr1;

3. weak pointer
are pointers similar to shared pointers
they just donot maintain/increment the reference count thus
they are called weak
