sets

1. sets are data structues used to store unique elements
2. duplicate elemenst are not stored in sets.
3. addition/del of elements is possible, Modification is not.
4. set is sorted by default
5. all ops = O(log n)
6. Implementation
set is a implementation of a self-balancing BST.
like red black tree.
7. traversal in trees is done through Iterators. 


set<int> s;    //normal set declaration
set<int, greater<int>> s ; //store elemnts in reverse order


UnOrdered set

1. Implementation is done using hashtable
2. sorted order is not here
3. all ops = O(1) avg case, O(n) worst case
